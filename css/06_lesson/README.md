## Styling Links

We can style links in CSS by selecting the anchor tag (_element selector_) often with pseudo-classes, to specify the link state on which the changes are to be applied.

| Selector    | Meaning                                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `a`         | Selects all the states                                |
| `a:link`    | A link that has a destination                         |
| `a:visited` | A link that has already been visited                  |
| `a:hover`   | A link that is hovered over by a user's mouse pointer |
| `a:focus`   | A link that is focused (_using the `Tab` key_)        |
| `a:active`  | A link that is activated (_by clicking on it_)        |
